Microservice Architecture Overview
1. Clients

Different types of clients (web, mobile, APIs) make requests to the system.

2. API Gateway

Acts as the single entry point for clients.

Routes requests to appropriate microservices.

Handles concerns like authentication, logging, rate limiting, etc.

3. Microservices

Each microservice is:

Small, focused on a specific domain (e.g., Auth, Payment, Order).

Independently deployable.

Communicates over HTTP (REST) or messaging queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka).

Maintains its own database (ensures loose coupling).
